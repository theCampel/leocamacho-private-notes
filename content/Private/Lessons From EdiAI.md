## Leading:
- ***Lofty work and autonomy motivates people:*** Remind people that they're a part of something great *(in our case, the AI society of one of the best schools in the world)* and that they can do anything *(Eg: nothing stopping us from getting DeepMind in to give a talk*).  
- ***Work visibly hard:*** This is obvious. The rest of the team should be equally invested, but if someone can't do something (non-technical obviously), the onus should fall on the leader to pick up the slack. They should know they're supported and not alone. *That said*, they should be invested to work through it even when it is hard.
- ***Give people autonomy:*** Give genuinely important (and difficult) tasks to competent people. Give them resources and motivation (through lofty [[Goals|goals]]). Don't just pawn off stuff you don't want to do. Check in frequently, but leave it as theirs. Give them credit every step of the way. 

## Team
- ***Quality of committee > Quantity of committee***. A small team of highly capable and motivated individuals will do ***far*** more work than a large team of half-assed mostly-interested people. 
- ***Corporate vs. Startup exists in Uni:*** Corporate vs Startups represents big, slow moving, lots of talk, established, reputable vs smaller, faster moving, unknown etc.. These are traits found in Uni societies as well. [[EUFS]], as great as it is, a behemoth. They've no problem recruiting, but often recruit like corporate.  

## Organisational Stuff:
- ***Upfront Time Commitment > Aggregated Time Commitment:*** Students prefer to give up a full Saturday and/or Sunday because they feel 

## Personal:
- ***Leading capable people is fucking amazing:*** I found I got so much energy after whole-team meetings.
