## Behavioural Interviews:
### Responding to Specific Questions:
> [!warning]+ Important Note!
> The most important thing to remember is: ***What do you bring to the table, and relate that to the position?*** 
> You bring:
> - *Passion to **move fast**.*
> - *Passion to **learn** and **build**.*
> - *Infectious **charisma** and energy.*
##### Behavioural
> [!quote]- How do you respond under pressure?
> *Recruiters want to hear **how you prioritise your work**, especially under tight circumstances. Say something like:*
> 
> "The secret I've learned to handling pressure is knowing how to prioritise urgent work and knowing when to ask for help. For example, this exact scenario came up for me when in running the AI Society. The final workshop of the year needed creating, coursework season had arrived, and I had to begin to prepare for exams. Because they were all important, I decided which to pursue based on urgency and their impending due dates. As well, I went to the team and told them that I wanted to finish the workshops to an incredibly high standard, and I didn't think that was possible, in the timeframe I had if I had done it on my own. As such, I needed their help. After all was said and done, we delivered our final workshop with great reviews, I finished my coursework and ended the year with a first. Also, when planning out the society events for this year, I've designed the timelines so this exact thing doesn't happen again."

> [!quote]- What's your biggest weakness?
> Idk... Come up with a good way of saying this:

> [!quote]- Why do you want to work for us?
> *Everyone is going to get asked this question. Use it as an opportunity to stand out. Bring your enthusiasm to the page. For example:*
> 
> When I researched the company, as well as asked about the life from current/former employees, a common theme kept coming up: You guys do interesting work in a fast paced environment. At my previous role at (prev company name), with it being such a large company, no matter how fast I tried to work, there was slow bureaucratic obstacles being put in my way. When I finished the internship, I decided I had to continue on somewhere where that pace is not only enabled, but encouraged. And naturally, your names popped up over and over.

> [!quote]- Why should we hire you?
> *Can probably just base this off the one above:*

So between bringing a a characteristic "hustle" to the team, as well as an infectious enthusiasm (of which I've been told about a lot), I'm confident I can contribute to the team.

> [!quote]- Tell me about yourself?
> *Explain the 5 things:* 
> - Your Background* 
> - *What you're passionate about* 
> - *Key skills you've built,* 
> - *1 sentence about what you hope to achieve from your next role*
> - *Something about you as a person*
>   
> "Hey I'm Leo! I'm a Mexican born, Irish reared University of Edinburgh student. I've previously worked at J.P. Morgan, A cyber-security startup in Ireland and am currently the president and co-founder of Edinburgh AI, the University's premier AI society. 
> 
> I've always been passionate about building and learning, and doing it fast. When I was 16, I learned that trading companies analyse the sentiment of headline articles to help inform their stock picks, so I went off and built a similar technology for Tweets (back when it was still called Twitter!). That passion for building hasn't stopped. 
> 
> I've worked at in startups, as well as a big corporate environment, and by far I prefer the fast paced nature that is building quickly. That's why I decided to apply to Optiver. When I researched around for companies doing interesting work at breakneck speed, Optiver's name kept coming up. 
> 
> Outside of that, I love running, cycling and swimming. I used to be a competitive swimmer for Ireland!"

> [!quote]- What's the last thing you learned, outside of the class? 
> *Interviewers want to see you, as an intern, are trying to actively grow (when you don't have to), outside of the class. Make them see that.*
> 
> Something I learned wasn't a hard-skill, but more how to manage a huge workload that involves other people. When I took on the position of president of the society, I got presented with a burden of work that I didn't even realise happened within the society. On top of that, because we were a small team, parts of it had to be delegated to some people. I learned very quickly to use Trello in my personal life, organise and prioritise urgent tasks, and delegate to the relevant people. 

> [!quote]- How do you deal with conflict?
> TODO: Do when you get to that stage


##### Situational (Tell me about a time when...):
TODO Include:
- Leadership
- Managing a team
- Working on a team
- Problem solving
- Overcoming failure
- Managing Stressful situation / challenge at work. 

##### Questions to ask the interviewer:
- "What does an intern have to do to get a return offer?"
- "The intern that stood out the most to you from last year's cohort, what did they do?"
