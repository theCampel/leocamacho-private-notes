## Obsidian:

This is where you take your [[Atomic Notes|Conceptual Notes]], as inspired by [[Steven Gong]]. A good video on getting started using Obsidian [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms).

### How to use:
- Use it for [[Atomic Notes]]:
	- As you learn something new, make a new short note about it. If it relates to something you've already done before, link it. This helps strengthen neural connections between the topics, further committing it to memory. 
- When finished writing a new note, do a "**Related Concept**" at the end, linking other related topics together. 

## Trello:
- Use this exclusively as a Kanban board. 
- Adopt links to idea from [[Four Thousand Weeks]], don't have more than 2 active goals at any time. Ideally one work related and one non work related.
