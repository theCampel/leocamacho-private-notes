> I really like this idea of goal chasing, but why 5? Would it not be better to have one main professional goal and one personal goal? 

How am I going to set it up? Have two main goals, 1 professional and 1 non-professional. I've a list of priorities that will always take priority in front of those tasks. I avoid everything else I can. 

My priorities are as follows:
1. Socialise
2. Stay Healthy
3. Something more
