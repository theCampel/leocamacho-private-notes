### 1st Round:
- Who we are / what we solve?
	- We're selling trust in AV's. 
- Consider your Target Market
- Whose we problem do we actually solve?
- Needs a Sustainability slide
- Needs a Finances slide

### 2nd Round:
How many people we can serve -> Data driven approach to how many vehicles we’ll have operating per year
o   Include in Number vehicles (in audio track?)
o   Fleet Size + Growth over Time, include in yours

-       Competition is personal vehicle owner ship, other buses, uber etc.
-       NRE costs: Non Recoverable Engineering cost
	o   A lot of money is going to be spent on validation -> Ie testing?
	o   Maintenance costs
	o   Cleaning
	o   Customer Support -> Remote Operators
	o   Refuelling People
	o   Cellular Costs (telematics -> Connectivity of vehicle)

Or are you gonna use On-Prem?
Data logging and data management is HARD man.
o   TCO -> Total cost of operations
o   Revenue vs Profit
o   Be upfront with investors about challenges
-       3D Printed parts -> Better not

Movar Notes:
- Increase a decent business case
o   Growth over time, financials etc
o   Investor wants to see where’s my money going, how far is it going to get you, what’s potential growth and when am I going to get my money back

-       Eyebrow raiser -> buses?
	o   Why?
	o   Need more explanation
	o   Go into, how we’re solving
	o   Hammer home on transport poverty
	o   Why don’t people use more buses
	o   What problem am I currently solving with buses atm?
	o   Are we actually improving the sustainability of the buses?

-       Are we planning on partnering with the city of Edinburgh?
	o   Touch on local governance
-       Include Map for routes
	o   Include explanation on why?
-       Condense all sensors onto one
	o   On 5 year plan, we can reduce cost by not buying some of the hardware
-       Production Line:
	o   “Path to production”. Doesn’t add a ton of value unless value of it is spoken
	o   “We are here” would be huge + add end date to it. \
-       Telematics missing for our finances as well as
-       We’re also missing the busses for finances
	o   We’re going to have to pay for the buses.
	o   Mounting is too low. 5-10k
	o   Moutnign, integration, etc.
-       Break out cap-ex, op-ex.

-       How’re we actually making money. How much are we charging.
	o   Subsidised income from City of Edinburhg
	o   How much does it cost to ride the bus.

-       2-3 year Plan:
	o   When talking about expansion, we want to go to Glasgow because….
		§  Eg they’re lacking a fundamental bus infracture, there’s a lacking bus infrastructure
		§  Get creative when talking about expansion
		§  Get creative

-       Expand more on production line & production Assembly and reduce the amount you have on the software.
-       Add mini descriptions under each point on production line
-       £200 for mounting is too little
-       £20k is too much for a computer
-       Justify why we’re spending too much on radar and not lidar
-       Higher people cost

### Individual Sandor Feedback:
Why not make the buses hydrogen and cars not?
- Have a decent justification for being electric buses
- Show a map of the routes
- JUstify the number of sensors is reasonable
- Define the size of bus - ie number of seats like volvo or coach or whatever
- Keep Software at a high level
- What would your factory look like?
- Discuss what each bit of production line means to us?
- Be more specific with design
- Spec out the total costs more accurately
- Always justify why you do anything.
- How do you make money?
- How does this business result in you breaking even
- What's expected ROI? When?
- Utilise government subsidies
	- Shows great awareness that the govt provides 

### Imogen also took these notes:
More business - if we are giving to investors we need to let them know the returns
Presentation needs to focus more on that
Overall deck needs to be more business plan
Eyebrow raiser - targeting buses
Add more about why people don't use buses?
What problem with current buses are we solving?
Collisions? 
Sustainaibility
Are we improving the sustainability or building on what is already there
Why are we not doing hydrogen fuel cell buses
Partnerships
Are we planning to partner with the city of edinburgh
Touch on the local governance
 
Routes
Make a map of the routes we are doing
Sell more clearly with a map
Spend more talking about why we have chosen certain routes
Sensors
Condense sensors into a single slide
Can he tell us the sensor stuff he was leaving out?
5 year plan
How we should reduce costs
Volvo is giving us a grant with the first 50 buses
'here's where we are going to have to pay it back'
Software
Do we need SLAM?
Production line
The actual line where you build the product
Talk about the timing of when we're going to be doing this
This is the investment that we need
Where are we in this project already
'late stages of this prototype'
'Plan to go into production around here'
Finance
Connetivity aspect
Cost of the bus
Mounting costs are too low - £5 - 10k
Break out the capital expenses and also operational expenses
Break down operational and capital expenses into cost per vehicle mile travelled
How much are we charging per ride
Subsidise income from the city of Edinburgh
How much does it cost to ride this book
5 year plan
When talking about expansion really be intentional
'we want to go to glasgow as they are lacking a bus infrastructure'
Inter city commuter
Get more creative and think about 'why' when talking about an expansion plan
 
 
SANDOR FEEDBACK
Makes sense for buses to run on hydrogen
Businesses building buses on hydrogen fuel cells as they are bigger
Make a relationship with the scottish government
Would like the UK government to support the business idea
When talking about expanding is Aberdeen - infrastructure is there already
Map in the routes slide
Talk to software about sensor placement
Expand into the production line and production assembly
Mini description under each point in production line
£200,000 per bus
Lidar and radar cost are reasonable but not the computer
Justify why we are using more radars than cameras
Take out the design bit
