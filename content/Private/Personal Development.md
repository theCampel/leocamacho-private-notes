## Physically:
> [!Danger] High Level
> Something you've been trying to do for a LONG time. 
> 1. Design a short term workout plan.
> 2. Design a long term workout plan.
> 3. Stick to it.
> 4. Eat in accordance with muscle building.
> 5. Develop functional strength

### Breakdown:
It's already divided into smaller, more actionable plans. This makes the implementation of it all so much easier to implement to Trello. 

## Productivity:
> [!todo] High Level
> You're not the most effecient worker/learner. Improve that.
> 1. Make a backbone of a **toolbox** (eg obsidian notes are tools). 
> 	- Flesh these out as you learn more about your tools.
> 2. Learn **how to [[Reading|read]]** and absorb knowledge as you read.
> 	- I want to *consume* books. That is, read **a lot** 
> 3. Learn **how to [[Learning|learn]]** quicker.
> 	- Incorporate those lessons into your workflow.
> 4. Learn how to **be more [[Effeciency|effecient]]** with your time.
> 	- Incorporate those lessons into your workflow.
> 


### How're you going to do this?
#### 1. Develop a [[Toolbox]]:
- Outline the tools you want to use
	- Outline the *envisioned use* of them
	- Have a page on tools?
		- Calendar
		- Trello
		- Obsidian
- Tools can include methodologies for stuff
	- EG Stuff you do after you read.
- Try to include research and resources into each of your choices

#### 2. [[Reading|Read]] More:
- Fill out the page on how best to read
- Develop an Obsidian section how to read
- Import all the books you want to read ofc. 
	- Or don't? Do it as you read books?

#### 3. [[Learning|Learn]] Quicker:
- I want to be better at absorbing and retaining knowledge, specifically in a school context. 
- This was driven mainly from the fact that I just don't absorb much in lectures. 

#### 4. Be More [[Effeciency|Effecient]]:
- The origin to this is interesting enough. In [[University of Edinburgh|1st year]] Sem2 I was in Appleton Tower **a lot**. Like genuinely, I'd be there from 09:00 -> 19:00, then eat and go out or socialise after. But even still, I felt like I just wasn't getting bang for my buck. I'd be there for 10 hours and get 3 hours worth of work done. So I wanted to fix that. 
- Find and detail ways to become more effecient. Discuss Forest, Distractable etc. 
- Also find ways to most optimally take breaks
- This also comes at a time where I find myself being far more reflective on where my time's going and how to not waste any. 


## Professionally:
> [!done] High Level
> To become the best worker and employee you could become, lay solid foundations now:
> 1. Make a digital garden. Again, similar to [[Steven Gong]]'s site. Just a place to show employers what you're working on.
> 2. Make a better Github that works on cool open-source stuff. 
> 3. Fully learn Java over the summer. Cover skipped topics you missed because of strikes. 
> 4. Publicly partake in projects, be it for self driving, for Ai, whatever. Ties in with point 2. 
> 5. Make a Free / paid newsletter for Ai stuff? Like this guy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1323qlg/gpt4_week_6_the_first_ai_political_ad_palantirs/).


### How are you going to do this?
Basically, this bit section of self improvement comes down to 3 things; 
- Have a better digital presence
- Have better, more employable skills
- Have examples of those skills being used.

This section is quite handy cos it'll be smaller steps that can all be completed on Trello. 




## Emotionally:
> [!abstract] High Level
> This section was originally first, but it's so damn hard to fix it's going last:
> 1. Develop Empathy - Stop subconciously putting yourself above others
> 2. Treat women better.
> 3. Learn, mature and evolve from previous life lessons.
> 4. Become "the person you'd like do date".
> 


### Breakdown:
These points revolve around "how to become more emotionally mature". It's quite a broad and tough question to be honest. I don't really know how to fix it to be honest. Read books on it?
#### 1. Developing Empathy:
- Practise gratitude

#### 2. Treat Women Better:
- Refer to journal

#### 3. Learn From Life Lessons:
- Journal reflectively
- Also refer to journal

#### 4. Become "The Person You'd Like to Date":
- Detail, in great depth, about the person you'd like to date. Their attributes, their characteristics, personality etc.. 
- Develop mini plans to further improve those miniplans

## [[Warren Buffet]] Prioritisation:
Known as the [[5-25 Rule]], according to some radom dude (Buffet), you should list out your top 25 priorities, circle the top 5 and avoid the rest like the plague. I've done the same for medium term goals. Here we go:

	BFD1. Includes travelling with friends
2. *Learn OOP / C++*
3. *Become Funnier*
4. *Become Healthier / more defined*
5. *Finish 4000 weeks*
6. Do F1 work
	1. Perception then Statics
7. Work on a public repo or public opensource project for machine learning
	1. "Good First Issue"
8. Become a tutor
9. Develop a system for becoming more productive in University
10. Make a public, open source machine learning project.
11. Develop a good, online presence documenting what you're learning
12. Make a personal website
13. Participate in the Open Source community
14. Build something really epic
15. Get a headstart on next years modules
16. Develop a way to make money.
17. Consistently Journal (is journalling not a tool / habbit?)
18. Read 3 books for pleasure
19. Research companies that will sponsor you to move to Australia
20. Research plans for going abroad
