## How to approach reading:

> [!hint] Tip 1: Quit Books quickly and without shame
> Quickly glance over a book. If it's worth reading, start it. If at any point you're begrudging getting to the next page, quit it and start a different book. "*Life's too short to not be reading the best book you know of right now*." - Patrick Collison


> [!example] Tip 2: Take good notes
> As you read, make atomic notes ***in your own words*** on the topic, linking it ([[Feynmen Technique|Feynmen Technique style]]) to another concept you know of. 
> 
> As well, periodically review these notes. You should be able to "reread" the book simply by going over your notes.
