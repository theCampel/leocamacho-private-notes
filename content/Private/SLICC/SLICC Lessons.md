# Proposal
### **Q1. What is the title of your learning experience Proposal?**
Using Machine Learning to Optimise Global Paths for EUFS' Autonomous Vehicle

### **Q2. How can you define the context of your chosen Learning Experience at the start of your SLICC?**
My SLICC, as a sub-project for EUFS, will be researching and applying new and novel methods of path optimisation utilising Machine Learning - specifically investigating Reinforcement Learning's applicability to a continuous output such as global path prediction. 

As the president of the EdinburghAI society, I have always had a keen interest in utilising ML for novel and important applications. Additionally, as a member of EUFS since my first year, I've always searched for ways to combine my passion for both. When I heard SLICC was an option to get credits for doing just that, I quizzed Alex for my eligibility - with success!

I will be working as a co-lead to the Simulation sub-team, with Alex Alderman Webb as my direct supervisor. As this is a separate project (from coding up the AV) but will still utilise the EUFS stack, I will need to investigate thoroughly how to link the two from more experienced members who have done just that. 

With the success of this project, a faster, more reliable global path can be used for the AV in Formula Student competitions. Path optimisation (which at the moment is choosing the midpoint of the track) is especially unreliable for sharp corners (which is a deceptively hard part of racing and one F1 drivers are particularly skilled at (source)). 

### **Q3. What is/are the aim(s) of your chosen learning experience? How will this learning experience contribute to your own development?**
Ideally, at the end of the project I have a trained RL model that is able to optimally choose the path for the EUFS AV.

Alex was always aware of my keen interest in ML. We came together and concluded that building an RL path optimiser would be an informative, novel application for the society. Additionally, I have never built an RL model, nor anything extra atop the EUFS stack - so this SLICC will provide me with a wealth of knowledge in both. I know I eventually want to go into applied research at a leading AI firm, and RL has consistently proved to be where most impactful developments lie (source, source). By developing a solid foundation in RL and robotics, I provide myself a more holistic background for my eventual application. 

I believe I will face countless problems. Firstly, building a distinct, but connected, project atop the EUFS stack is an uncommon and not well-documented pursuit. I will need to ask more experienced members the best way to go about this, which will improve my communication skills. Additionally, RL on racing cars is a novel application of RL, with limited documentation - which will inevitable result in a smaller pool of helpful resources to pull from when I encounter problems. My investigative skills will need to improve for the success of this project.

I also find this field incredibly interesting. I'm elated to be able to investigate and apply my interests for credit. 

## **Q4.  How do you intend to demonstrate you have achieved each of the five Learning Outcomes?**
### **Q4a. Learning Outcome 1: I am able to demonstrate how I have actively developed my critical understanding of the topic of my SLICC.**

I will develop my understanding of Reinforcement Learning as well as ability to build atop of a complex system. The skills and techniques I hope to gain will serve me well for when I eventually move onto the same field in industry. Additionally, I gain a lot of fulfilment and satisfaction from working on ML projects that directly impact others. 

The immediate questions I need to clarify is how to extract data from the EUFS stack, as well as what is the general approach for RL to take (there are multiple different "strains" of RL (source)). The single biggest problem here will be trying to make decisions for either that involve the other. For example, depending on how I build atop the EUFS stack will affect the choice of RL architecture. Or choosing a specific kind of autonomous vehicle algorithm will affect the sort of data I need from other subteams. 

A lot of research and investigation will be required. First, by interviewing and asking the rest of the EUFS team for any potential ways they have built atop the stack previously. This will help give me a guiding path to go down. 

As for the second main challenge, I will explore the following docs and approaches to help hone down the specific approach I will take:

- Steven Gong's Approach on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R87Qlq_wSY8&t=47s) / [GitHub](https://github.com/CL2-UWaterloo/f1tenth_ws)
- Understanding the different applications of [RL on robotics](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=Iqi_m8HT-X5k) from leading labs
- Investigate SpinningUp by [OpenAI](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html)

I will have created weekly blogs where I detailed all of my new (and old) learnings about the technologies and approaches. Additionally, I will have created a project that would not have been possible with only a surface level understanding of either RL or the EUFS stack.

### **Q4b. Learning Outcome 2: I am able to draw on and apply a range of relevant skills and attributes (academic, professional and/or personal) in order to engage effectively and critically with my SLICC, identifying where I need to improve these and/or develop new ones.**

As part of being EdinburghAI's president, I have gained good communication skills. Additionally, in my pursuit of expanding my ML knowledge (as well as Computer Science more holistically), I have learned how to learn quickly and adapt to new unseen challenges. I believe both of these skills are relevant to my SLICC. I will invariably need to ask questions to people with more experience as well as learn about material that is beyond my current breadth of knowledge already. 

I, having completed lots of self-directed coding projects before, have competent coding skills. This will definitely come in crucial for the coding based project. 

Additionally, my skill for time management has much room for improvement. I tend to focus on getting certain projects completed to an incredibly high degree - but often at the expense of other projects not getting touched. Due to the nature of SLICC, improving this skill is going to be crucial to the success of my project.

I fear that these skills will not be enough to complete my project to a high standard. There is likely another skill that I'm missing that will come in crucial for my project - you don't know what you don't know! 

That said, an immediate pain point I foresee is needing a higher standard of coding. I'm aware I'm not the best coder - which will likely result in hardship at some point of the project. 

I will ask Alex to review my code to help improve it's quality and spot any gaps where it is lacking.

By _**doing**_ is a key way. I'm a firm believer that actively building is one of the best ways to learn new skills. I have already began reading articles about how AV's utilise RL in practise ([source](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/27/1052826/ai-reinforcement-learning-self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles-wayve-waabi-cruise/)).

### **Q4c.  Learning Outcome 3:  I am able to demonstrate how I have used experiences during my SLICC to critically develop my skills in the focussed area of...research and enquiry**

**Explain your choice below**
I have chosen to improve my skills in research and inquiry. I have chosen this as I eventually want to go into academia, and research is by far the most critical skill to obtain. While I'm comfortable with a lot of different technologies, my ability to apply bleeding edge tech leaves room for improvement. 

I expect it to be time-consuming to improve the skill of research. The skills is improved by reading academic papers, applying the techniques to your given project and iterating over it. Reading papers on its own is time consuming, so balancing that with actually building the project is likely to culminate in a lot of time spent.

By also improving my time management skills, I will hopefully gain a good balance of learning the frontier techniques as well as applying them in a practical way.

I will document all of the research papers, documents and blogs I have read in the process of finding an optimal way to complete the project. Additionally, my ability to explain the novel / advanced techniques will show an aptitude for research - after all, you can't teach / explain something if you don't understand how it works.

### **Q4d.  Learning Outcome 4: I am able to demonstrate how I have used experiences during my SLICC to develop my mindset towards ...aspiration and personal development**
Explain below:

I chose to focus on aspiration and personal development. I believe I currently have quite lofty and aspirational goals, but these slowly wither when not fed with similarly aspirational projects. On the contrary, when tackling incredibly hard projects (and then succeeding!) you're reminded that what your previously defined as "lofty" was now the new benchmark for standard. 

I want to be actively tackling that kind of project so my benchmark for "aspiration" is constantly raised. And making a car drive itself? That firmly fits the criteria for "lofty".

The problem with constantly reaching for "lofty" is that it can get quite hard quite quickly. The time requirements, expertise level and motivation all grows with your level of aspiration. It can be particularly hard to sustain that, especially during peak Uni season. 

I expect to be able to reassess my mentality by periodically reviewing the output on all areas of the SLICC. If I feel the quality has dropped, it's likely because of my mindset has changed. Should this be the case, further action would be required (likely a weekend of rest!)

Often during University, when motivation takes a dip, rest is the single best thing one can do - it recharges people and helps give them a fresh perspective. Moreover, as I'm doing a SLICC project within EUFS, I will be able to lean on the other SLICC members, as well as my subteam, for support should the time require it. 

By the end of the module, I will have built a successful project, covering topics I have never covered before. The project itself will be a gleaming example of tackling new ventures and personal development.

### **Q4e. Learning Outcome 5: I am able to evaluate and critically reflect upon my approach, my learning, my development and my judgement throughout my SLICC.**

I've always learned in a myriad of ways:

- I delve deep into the area of which I'm trying to learn about. This can include watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, reading blogs / articles or even asking people in the field for their takes. 
- I'm a firm believer of learning by doing. I've always tried to build utilising the new knowledge I recently picked up. My aptitude for the new subject is immediately obvious based on the quality of what I had just built. 
- I always try to teach the subject to people who know it less. I feel by doing this, I'm forced to cover the foundations and truly understand it.

These methods will definitely force me to fully _**understand**_ the concept of what I'm teaching / researching / building. Additionally, by teaching it to others, I would likely think of new ways to approach the problem / new applications for the same technology but in other places of the stack. 

My stance on tendency to teach will likely have to adapt to "integrate". At the end of the day, the long term goal is we develop a faster path around the track. The ability to integrate any software into the stack and train any other society members to use this is crucial.

- I will be updating the blog weekly. I intend to jot the problems down as I encounter them and then flesh out the blogs the morning after. That way, I have ample time to tackle the problem, but also a fresh perspective to critically evaluate my work after the fact.
- I intend to use a reflective model, such as, but not limited to, the _Gibbs reflective_ model or the _What, So What, No What?_ model.  While I enjoy writing, a reflective style of writing is often harder to output without a structure to follow. 
- When I learn a new topic, I religiously follow a specific note taking format (Atomic note taking as opposed to sequential note taking). Anytime I use any new information, I'm able to refer to the atomic notes I've previously taken. When I invariably end up reviewing my notes, I will be actively reflecting on the information I've learned through SLICC - as well as the accuracy of it. 

The course is a full year long. One of the main challenges I fear is reflecting (accurately) at the end of the year, especially when it's concerning specific design decisions made all the way in early semester 1. This can be overcome by being disciplined and detailed with the blogs, as well as organised notes that can be easily referenced later.
