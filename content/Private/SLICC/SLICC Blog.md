### ***Date: Between October 8th -> November 6th:***
### What:
***"Starting is half the battle"*** - and what a battle it's been! Since I last wrote, I've had surgery, got a new laptop and faced bugs no one in EUFS has ever faced!

To begin with, I had to go home for surgery on October 10th. This caused me to lose a lot of the momentum I had gained with my university. When I finally returned to Edinburgh, with a new laptop underarm, I was forced to install the EUFS stack again. I didn't expect this to prove as a difficult a task as it did, all thanks to Apple's custom M2 silicon chip. I struggled to even find a way to run Ubuntu - dual-booting wasn't sufficing. I resorted to asking how other team members did it and following their footprints. This eventually led me to UTM and, a few hours later, success! 

After flying through the EUFS setup guide, I eventually ran into a bizarre terminal x EUFS stack bug. Again, stuck for hours and frustrated beyond belief, I asked Said, the developer who created the setup tool. He sat down with me for a meeting and we debugged the setup tool together. Said had basically mastered this part of the stack, and I found it both fascinating and impressive how he was able to fly through the debugging as if he had done it his entire life.

### So What?
It's humbling and frustrating constantly facing error after error in a domain you know little about (for me, the stack setup tool). It took a lot of resilience on my side to keep at it and not give up, with nearly calling it quits multiple times. Also, I wouldn't have been nearly as resilient had I been on my own - having someone else next to me made the entire process easier. Upon further reflection, that's the sort of working environment in which I thrive - being set in front of a problem and trying my best, while having a teammate to lean on *when* things get tough. This has never actually been clear to me.

Also, becoming inspired from someone so technically capable further drove my resilience. It appears to be a cycle, where I get inspired, work on a hard problem, need someone more capable, learn, get more inspired, work on an even harder problem and so on. I seem to work best, most efficiently and have the most ***"fun"*** when I work to this cycle. 

### So What?
Problems are inevitable. I should design my working routine such that I work with (and around) people that are smarter than me as often as possible. I'll try sit next to them in meetings, and come to them for help when needed (but only after giving it a significant shot myself). This will help keep me resistant to hard problems and inspire me more day after day.

### ***Date: From September -> October 8th***

### What: 
It's been a hectic few weeks. I've only just started my 3rd year at University and feel like we've been immediately thrown in the deep-end -- a far cry from the chill-by-comparison first 2 years. The workload, even in the first couple of weeks, is much more than than I've previously faced. This is all to say that as my SLICC is a full year course with no immediate deadlines, it's been put on the back burner. I've thus not prioritised the important but not-urgent tasks. 

While Alex (my direct lead) and I have long had a rough idea of what my project was going to look like, it was only yesterday that we sat down and hammered out specifics. 

### So What:
Well frankly, it's been stressful - which should have been obvious when designing an academic year with a 70-50 split in terms of credits. It's also obvious that this inevitability was the direct result of a lack of foresight and forward thinking (from a summer Leo). 

This is the first time I've ever had a split module - a 20 credit course split into 2 semesters with assessment exclusively at the end of semester 2. As a result, I'm unsure how best to split my time - especially considering it's entirely self-organised. My organisation is thus lacking - having routinely put off the important-but-not-urgent work. While this doesn't spell the end of the world right now, it's making creating a stressful period for future-me (again, surfacing my inability for future planning and organisation). 

### Now What:
Well it's pretty clear that planning seems to be a weak-point for me, so a sit down session detailing exactly what I'm going to do, and how I'm going to do it, is in order.  Making a plan of the next steps for my project, as well as just starting, seems like a wise endeavour. 

In terms prioritisation, it's also unclear the correct balance. That said, a logical approach would be to spend my normal society commitment, as well as additional prep-hours on the SLICC. The prep can be for the blog, light research or meeting with the other SLICC members for support. 

Now off to doing that!
