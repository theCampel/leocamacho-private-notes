Linked closely with the  [[Compound Effect]], it tells the story of two people, someone on a downward and upward spiral. 

Everyone knows the story of the unfortunate drunk.

> [!quote] Unfortunate Drunk
> A kind, caring, hardworking man forgot to set his alarm one morning. He woke up late one morning and missed his early meeting at work. To catch up, he stays up late at night and gets no sleep that night. Over time, he cements a poor sleeping pattern.
> 
> To compensate, he begins to socialise more and develops a drinking / going out habit. This makes him perform even worse at work, resulting in him losing his job. This makes him want to drink more, with his physical health taking a tremendous toll.

> Eventually, he's **[[Compound Effect|2.5%]]** the man he was.

By taking on minor habits that slowly made him worse, the negative effect they held compounded to make him wholly worse.

***Fortunately***, *the same is true in reverse.* By taking on small habits that make you just a tiny bit better, we can become *unrecognisably* ***better*** over time. 

> [!note] The Ambitious Student
> An average student began working up earlier to commit more time to the gym. After getting accustomed to it, he found he had far more energy to spend studying in the afternoon. 
> 
> As he achieved better grades, he began to get recognition from highly reputable employers and tutorers. As well, with his newfound physical shape, he began to recieve more attention from other girls. Both of this bolstered his confidence to pursue new ambitious ventures.

> He became [[Compound Effect|37x]] the man he was.
