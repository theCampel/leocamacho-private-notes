### Things to get before moving:
Obviously you need your visa and all, but don't forget the small things like down below:
- Yeti Waterbottle (or crappier Chilli's alternative)
- Waterproof GoPro

### Employment Opportunities:
The goal as of writing is to get a nice high paying job doing something in [[Tech Jobs|tech]], ideally applying Machine Learning. However do research alternatives:
- FIFO: "Fly In Fly Out" - Extremely soul crushing hours and work in exchange for a FAT paycheck in the end. Everyone there wants to leave but the money is too good. Could consider for a month or so. 
- Remote, accommodation sorted, tourism jobs. They pay really well, food and accom is often provided and work is seasonal.
