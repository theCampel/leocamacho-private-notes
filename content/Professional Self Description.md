## Summary
My name is Leo Camacho, and I'm a Mexican-born, Irish-reared Computer Science Student at the prestigious University of Edinburgh. I have a drive and ambition to learn quickly and apply those concepts in a fast paced environments. 

## Professional Experience:

#### Internship @ NeuroCONCISE LTD.
**Jun 2019 - Aug 2019 · Derry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom**
###### *What did they do:*
NeuroCONCISE is a Ulster University Magee spin-off startup company who specialised in providing a a discrete wearable EEG for locked-in patients. The locked-in patients would be able to communicate wirelessly through the EEG. The EEG would be connected to an app controlled by the patients' carers. NC had to develop the companion app as well. 
###### Responsibilities / Learnings (As on LinkedIn)
- Responsible for designing and improving a prototype clinical application used for interpreting the brain data of immobilised patients in clinical trials.  
- Worked within an Agile Development environment to develop bleeding edge MedTech solutions.  
- Utilised technologies from XML to Git.
###### Notes:
The internship was incredibly interesting and my first real foray into tech. My direct report was Damian Coney. He was an experienced Dev who first showed me how to use Git, Kanban and basic software engineering principals. The work we were doing was inspirational (Note: Talk about this during interviews). There were people who, previously paralysed to a severe degree, after utilising our tech, were able to interact with the world in a more seamless manner. I worked on helping develop the app, using XML. 


#### Security Intern @ ITUS Secure Technologies
**Sep 2021 to Sep 2022 · Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland**
###### What did they do?
ITUS was a startup (5 people team) that was split into 2 parts; a managed service provider and a startup building a fintech product for insurance companies. The MSP was in charge with improving the cyber-security posture of small and medium businesses. This could be anything, from getting them anti-viruses, backups etc, managing their MS365, to helping them recover from a cyber attack like ransomware. The product they were building (which they outsourced to a software dev company) was a dashboard for small and medium businesses that allowed them to quantify and analyse their risk. This gave them the opportunity to improve their security posture. ITUS could also take all of this information and sell it to insurance companies to help them quantify cyber risk and sell insurance against it.

###### Roles (As on LinkedIn)
- Cyber Incident Responder: Investigated and aided the recovery of Cyber Crime victims. I analysed the nature of different strains of ransomware and investigated its origins. Examined logs to determine the origin of attacks, as well as determining the areas to further secure. 
- Provide Managed Services: I aided in providing a managed service to clients of different domains. The services ranged from simple IT support to deploying a large scale phishing training. 
- Secured Computer Networks: Onboarded new clients, hardening their networks with password policies, endpoint protection and best practises. 
- Investigated and Documented Cyber: I was responsible for writing company blogs documenting the latest trends in cybersecurity and the best practises to adopt to maintain the best posture. These ranged from embracing patch management to the vitality of security training.
###### Notes:
I enjoyed this job a lot, and worked their for a full year, meaning I got quite well integrated with the team. Clare, the CEO, was quite an enterprising person, while also being a good boss and manager. I didn't learn a whole lot of technical skills. The most I technical thing I did was be a software tester for their product which was in development, or help fix minor errors with their website. More often than not, I was assisting on the harder MSP stuff. This meant managing a client's infrastructure, giving them backups, implementing end-point protection etc.. Alternatively, I would be writing blog posts about how best to improve their infrastructure. I often went to a conferences, startup hubs etc. I learned a lot about cyber in that role, especially because I complemented that information with my own learnings. 


#### Software Engineer Intern @ JPMorganChase
**Jun 2024 to Aug 2024 · Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom · On-site**
###### What did they (my team) do?
My team was the Atlas Marketplace team. Since JPMC is an incredibly large organisation with an incredible amount of engineers (that are all under incredible amounts of scrutiny from regulators), the company needs to standardise how they operate within the cloud. The company thus developed a "marketplace", where engineers who're building an application, can go and select the AWS resources that they would like to include in their codebase. The resources will easily be ported to their app, and will come with all of the necessary logging and security rules required for the heavily scrutinised company. My team was in charge of managing that "marketplace". Because JPMC's infrastructure needs to be incredibly fault-tolerant, our team was mainly focused around building drastically robust pipelines, that ensured all code pushed followed strict standards.

###### What did I do (not on LinkedIn):
- Worked with another intern to build a web-app to help prevent the accumulation of unnecessary permissions on AWS. We built a dashboard, having sketched it in Figma, built the front end with React and backend with Flask. 
- I reinforced my ability to learn a new API from docs (for using their API's), learned GraphQL, REST.
- Practised Agile (stand-ups, retro's etc.).
- Learned **a lot** about cloud (JPMC is AWS's number 1 client). Gained hands-on experience with Terraform and AWS. Learned all about Lambdas, EC2s, CloudWatch, AWS logs, etc.. Also saw first-hand the pipelines that are built around all of this. 
- Honed my ability to ask good questions. 

###### General Notes:
1. My team was great. I got incredibly lucky to be placed in a team with a manger (Ryan) who tried to enable us as much as possible, gave great guidance when necessary, and actively rooted us to learn and succeed, both at the company and beyond. The team was incredibly supportive. Often we had problems, so (after trying a bit ourselves), would turn to an expert on the team (that were often sat around us) and ask them for their advice on how to proceed. Also, the team's culture of being kind and having fun was incredibly welcoming (we put memes in our retrospectives). 
2. The company had a culture of: *"How does it scale?"*. We constantly had to ask ourselves *"How can we build such that, if it 'grows arms and legs', it will continue to scale fine."*. This culture of thinking big definitely stuck with me. 
3. I want to work somewhere that moves faster, and at a higher level. JPMC felt like a slow-moving behemoth. There were lots of things that prevented quick pace (long wait-times for code checks to proceed prevented quick iteration cycles, legal gets involved on some of the more frontier projects - eg with , there was no culture of hustle).
	1. I also liked the comfortable culture. There were lots of perks, I had relatively easy days of no crazy deadlines, and there was no culture of hustling lol. I would like to work somewhere like JPMC when I'm older and need a more stable life (eg when raising kids), but in my 20's, it's not the place I would like to be. Rapid progression was definitely possible, but the definitely the exception, not the norm. 
4. Because of a prevalent issue we had with setting up on the cloud (ironically), we didn't get to complete the project to a level we were extremely happy with. Close to the end, we decided to leave the code in a "hand-offable" state. We ensured code hygiene, scalability in the code and clear documentation. 


## Extra Experience:

#### Co-Founder & President @ EdinburghAI
**Dec 2023 to Present · Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom**

##### What we do:

🔥 ***Edinburgh AI’s Mission Statement:*** 
Edinburgh AI empowers and shapes students and the broader community, transforming them into the next generation of pioneering AI builders and researchers.

- *We’re hosting our yearly flagship competition* (BTYoung Scientist-esque, Aka Science Fair style).
    - Students enter a AI-centred projects ahead of competition.
    - Students display their projects at the University - science-fair style
    - Winners are selected on the day
    - The event also has our sponsors interviewing the contestants
    - While the minority, there are contestants from other universities across the UK.
    - Part of the marking criteria is: “Are contestants utilising techniques taught at workshops?
- We’re hosting fortnightly workshops
    - The workshops are split into two parts: The Learning Hub and The Collaboration Hub
    - The Learning Hub teaches different topics (to all those interested) every month (I.e. every 2 sessions).
        - The timetable for which topics will be covered when are publicised on our website
        - The learning sessions cover a short 5-10 minute lecture on it works
        - Followed by 90 minutes where students are following a Jupyter Notebook on how to code such a task
    - The Collaboration Hub is for anyone working on AI projects, Kaggle Competitions etc.
        - More information for this part would be nice
- Expert Talks, Fireside Chats, Roundtables and Debates
    - Experts from industry and academia come and give interesting talks on the stuff they’re working on.
    - We gather notable people in industry and host panels and roundtables to talk about the state of AI, techniques etc.
    - Debates (from students and/or industry) ranging AI ethics, data misuse etc.
    - We've previously hosted:
	    - Amazon Advertising
		    - Discussed how to build models and deploy them at the sheer scale Amazon operates at.
		- KeySight Technologies
			- Discussed how AI is being incorporated into the development of 5G. 
		- Spotify
			- Discussed how they use GraphQL and AI to recommend the songs and podcasts that they do. 

##### Notes & Learnings:
- I started society because I really wanted a space where I could learn more about AI, as well as network with some really smart and interesting people. When I told a friend, he put me in touch with Pascual, a Masters student. Together, we founded the society and recruited our friends to come and get involved. From the get-go, we had a grand vision for where the society could go. I've taken the "laissez-faire" approach. 

- When I became president I got thrown an inordinate amount of work. I very quickly had to learn how to manage my time, lead a team and operate a startup-like entity, especially for when reaching out sponsors and speakers. We're a small team, opting for small and highly capable, as opposed to a team too large. 


#### Edinburgh University Formula Student
**Sep 2022 to Present · 2 yrs 1 mo**

###### Roles (as on LinkedIn):
- Researched and developed a viable business plan for an autonomous vehicle company to navigate the streets the Edinburgh and transport people from areas of "transport poverty".

- As well, partook in Real World AI, where I investigated racial biases within autonomous vehicle algorithms, detailed and researched the efficacy of V2V and analysed Japan's readiness for SAE Level 4 vehicles.

###### Notes:
- In my first year, I researched a lot about Autonomous Vehicles, safety and regulation surrounding AI in transport and how technologically progressive different parts of the world were. I also practised my pitching skills. When competing at FSUK AI 2023, our division (statics) was a key driver for the teams success. 
- In my second year, I held committee without doing anything. (But I had the title of PR Manager).

#### Other Miscellaneous Stuff:
###### Twitter Bot, 2018 (14 Years old!!):
- I learned about Natural Language Process through a YouTube video (although the story I tell trading companies is I learned that Trading companies use sentiment analysis for stock picks.). I followed along to build my own sentiment analysis, but this time for Tweets - and seeing if certain Tweets were "harrasive" or not. I then integrated this with Twitters (then good) API and made a bot that could detect the "harrasive-ness" of a Tweet and then report it if it deemed to be bullying. 
- I learned about Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, 1-hot encoding, data-cleanliness with Pandas, data visualisation with Matplotlib, Tensorflow, the idea of back-propagation and a lot more. This was my first real foray into AI and ML, and I loved it. I've been learning every since.
- I submitted it into the SciFest, an Irish science-fair. I did well and learned a lot, and took my learnings forward to compete at the BTYSE. I did very well in it, winning my category. It was from there I got a job at NeuroCONCISE. (This also served the inspiration for EdinburghAI).
- This was something I'm still very proud of to this day. The project was called "Making Social Media Better Place, Using Artificial Intelligence" (back when it wasn't as cool lol). 
- I got featured on our local news, received a lot of recognition and got my first internship.
###### Vex Robotics, 2020
- In 2020, I took part in a Vex Robotics competition. We won our regional division, but the nationals were cancelled due to Covid. I learned little (that I remember) from it, but it was a cool experience. 
###### JPMC Code For Good, 2023
- I competed in their local hackathon, which was all about doing a building code that helped an important local cause. We had to come up with a way to make Glasgow Children's Hospital "the best gaming hospital in the world".
- We made a dashboard with a LangChain-powered chatbot that could interact with the children as they played games. I was in charge of making the Chatbot work.
- I met a lot of cool people, and was one of the top performers at the hackathon that I was immediately offered a job the day after.
