A common question is how do I start to learn X. [[Andrej Karpathy]] taught me that's the wrong way of thinking about it. There's some good philosophies to have:

> [!danger] Firstly, just start it
> You're better starting ***imperfectly*** and [[Self-Reflection|getting better]] than being paralyzed by the delusion of perfection (and then never starting).

> [!note] Use Atomic Notetaking
> By taking small atomic notes on a new idea within a topic, try and relate it to something you already know. 
> 

> [!tip] Constantly Revise with Feynmen Technique
> Constantly challenge yourself by asking "Why?" and try to teach the topic to a 10 year old. This will point out gaps, for which you should revise and relearn.
