It's a huge field, but basically imagine the world as mad up of [[Functions]]. In other words, the world ([[ðŸ’» Computer Science|computer science]] more specifically) is made up of problems that you can give an input and it returns an output. Feed it photos of a dog? It returns the breed. 



### Some Starting Points:
