## But What Actually Is It?
It's a huge field, but basically imagine the world as made up of [[Functions]]. In other words, the world ([[ðŸ’» Computer Science|computer science]] more specifically) is made up of problems that you can give an input and it returns an output. Feed it photos of a dog? It returns the breed. Give it a bunch of words in a sentence and it outputs the next one. 

Machine Learning is all about finding ways to find those functions. *(In an unreal and oddly roundabout way, sometimes we're trying to [[Algorithm Distillation|learn the algorithms that we already know]].)*


## *"How Do I Learn AI?"*:

> This is by no means the most efficient way of learning ML. It's adjacent to This exposes you to many different parts of the 


1. Dive into the world first. Follow:
	1. [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com), 
	2. [AI Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@aiexplained-official), 
	3. [[Andrej Karpathy|Andrej]] [Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy), 
	4. [Noam Brown](https://x.com/polynoamial)
	5. There's so many more to even list.
2. Learn how to code with Pandas. If you don't know how:
	1. ***Do not use [[ChatGPT in Education|ChatGPT]] for the following.***
	2. Spin up a Google CoLab for Python. 
	3. Watch this entire [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw?si=-FbeXP0X9NdubI6W) in full. Watch it in 2x. 
		1. Build something you want to build as you watch the video. (EG. Terminal based calculator, a dummy authentication service (bonus points if you learn about and implement [[Cryptographic Hash Functions|hashing]], etc.). The point here is creativity and building something you really want to build). 
3. Watch the following:
	1. [3Blue1Brown DeepLearning Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
	2. Watch and Do Andrej Karpathy's tutorials / videos ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), [here](https://youtu.be/zduSFxRajkE?si=P8X9-ClP4bT3ni5z))
4. Pick something you're interested in the [[AI]] (Eg [[Computer Vision]], [[Language]], etc.)
	1. Take vision for example. 
	2. Decide to be able to detect if your face, live on your webcam, is happy, or sad or whatever. 
	3. Look online for blogs of people doing this and showing how they did it. 
5. Do [[EdinburghAI|EdinburghAI's]] workshops (available [here](https://github.com/EdinburghAI/workshops)). Instructions are available on the ReadMe. For the theory, watch YouTube videos (we've unfortunately not made the videos live lol). 
6. Pick a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). 
	3. Ask a question about the data and try to answer it programmatically. EG:
		1. Given a dataset on English movie reviews and whether they were positive or negative, could you come up with a model that takes a review and says if it's positive or negative?
		2. Given a dataset of different countries, their GDP, average years schooling, average BMI etc, make a bunch of graphs that compares 2 different criteria. Eg. Average BMI vs Life Expectancy
			1. As an additional step, could you come up with a model that given an average BMI (and all of the other factors), you predict their life expectancy.
7. If you've just done everything here, you've simply dipped your toes in. Every step you take, ask "*why?*" until you're stopped by the laws of physics. Follow every question you have. Commit to [[Personal Projects|building]] something before you even know how to build it.
