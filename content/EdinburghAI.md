## What Do We Do? 
- ***Host Talks:*** We've had [[Google DeepMind]], Amazon and Spotify (and more!) give talks. With [[AI|AI-based]] talks from robotics to recommendation systems, I've learned something new every talk.

- ***Workshops:*** These were split into 2 parts:
	- ***Beginner-Friendly:*** Taught the fundamentals of [[AI|Machine Learning]] in a beginner-friendly way. Check them out [here](https://github.com/EdinburghAI/workshops)!
	- ***Advanced:*** For those with a better grasp of concepts, we held reading and discussion groups, reading the latest papers and tools like [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)!


- ***EdinburghAI Expo:*** Our flagship event is a *science-fair-like* event. It works like so:
	- Students apply at the start of the school year. 
	- They choose a project (given a [rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Og-5sb80sQZB22dMDoYmqZHs5oVK3MA/view)) and start to build a project they think would do well!
	- On the day of the event, academia, industry, students and researchers alike come together and view the projects on display. 
	- The projects will be judged on the day and the top teams will win some sweet prizes (first place 2024 was Â£1000 ðŸ¤‘).
