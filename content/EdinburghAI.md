Hey ____!

  

**_Important: Fill out the_** [**_form_**](https://forms.gle/UDpufcaum141cguy8)**_._** _(Only 1 person per team needs to fill it out)._ 

  

We noticed you weren’t at yesterday’s session. We wanted to check in and see how everyone was getting on - as well as provide some help if needed. 

  

We hope you’re still planning on coming along to the Expo. We get it’s a busy period at with Uni work right now, but I highly recommend you don’t drop out now. There’s set to be some pretty cool people at the event, from academics to industry. Even if you don’t have a finished product to show, I guarantee you’ll get some value out of showing up and presenting your idea. 

  

Regardless, below here’s the information we shared yesterday evening:

  

- Doors open to the public at 11:00, November 16th. We expect you to be there from 10:00, to allow you time to set up and even view the other contestants’ projects!
- More information about the timing of the whole event will be published in due time.
- We _highly_ recommend you print an A3 poster describing your project. This can look however you like! We will provide the poster-board for it. There’s A3 printers in Appleton Cafe and the Library’s uPrint / Makerspace.
- As a reminder, the rubric is posted on [www.edinburghai.org/expo](http://www.edinburghai.org/expo) .
- We will have a final information session next Monday the 11th at 4:00, in room 5.04. 



Finally, if you have any questions, feel free to message us!
Best,

Leo
