#EUFS 

> [!info] Description
> Formula Student is a competition hosted in Silverstone, England every year. The society of the same name, Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS-> "you-ef-es") played a massive role in my first year (and beyond?) of [[ðŸŽ“ University of Edinburgh MOC|University]]. 



## The Competition:
The competition is made up of two parts; the [[Driverless (ADS)]] and DDT. Both also have [[Statics]]

### Dynamic Driver Tasks (DDT):
Stands for *Dynamic Driver Tasks* and are about building a race car and making a driver race it. This is more an [[engineering]] side that you'll probably rarely interact with. The people in it are really cool though.

### [[Driverless (ADS)]]:
