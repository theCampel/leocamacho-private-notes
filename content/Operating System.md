## What?
It's the interface between a computer's hardware and the software running and users. It handles:
- [[CPU - Processor Components]]
- [[Virtual Memory]]
- [[IO]] and more...

### Potential [[Computer Security]] Concerns:
- The computer may have users with different permissions to the resources of the computer. The OS should have mechanisms to ***isolate different users***. 
- The OS should have a way to run different applications at the same time, ***safely***. The terminal (or malicious app) shouldn't be able to access the memory of your web-browser.
