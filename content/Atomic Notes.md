## What's it all about?
The idea is simple. When learning something and taking notes, don't dissect it into the week or [[University of Edinburgh|uni module]] in which you learned it. Instead, make a note that breaks that idea into [[First Principals|first principals]]. If you touch on another concept, simply link to it. 

**Your brain doesn't dissect ideas into weeks / topics, why should your notes?**

Try it out, you can jump around endlessly (eg: [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]]).  

### Tips for Atomic Notes:
- It should be incredibly easy to make new notes on new topics (that may build on old ones). 
- It should be incredibly easy to search for particular ideas. (Use `Omnisearch` for that.)
- You have to start somewhere. It's another example of the [[Compound Effect|compound effect]]. Make 1 note at a time.
- Write concisely with high entropy.
- ***Don't be lazy. Make good notes now***, *especially* for things you don't understand well *(easier said than done)*. What you don't understand now, you'll understand less later. 
- Write so that if you forgot everything about a concept, a page (and all of it's links) could teach you it from scratch. For example: [[(MIPS) Assembly Language]] details everything, while linking to other relevant prerequisites.
