title: Hey! I'm Leo 👋

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at the [[🎓 University of Edinburgh|University of Edinburgh]]. Welcome to my corner of the internet! 

### About Me:
- I co-founded my University's AI Society, [[EdinburghAI]], where I'm currently president.
- I'm an active member of [[🏎️ EUFS MOC|Edinburgh University Formula Student]], a society that builds self driving race cars from scratch. I'm currently trying to use [[Reinforcement Learning]] to optimise the global path around the race track. 
- This past summer, I interned at JPMorganChase as a software engineer! 

> [!question] What is this website?
> It's a blend of my University notes, [[Personal Projects|personal projects]] and written [[Essays|essays]]! You can search for a given topic using the 🔍 icon at the top (eg. *"Memory Hierarchy"*). Alternatively, you can just click around (eg. [[(Computer) Memory Conceptually|Computer Memory]])!

> These notes are primarily for myself while I [[Learning|learn]] something new. They're far from perfect and were never intended for an audience. But hey, that's how I learn.

> Also, some hyperlinks may not work - they're likely private notes (eg. [[Spirals|Spirals in Life]])

### Where I've Worked:
- In Summer 2023, I interned at JPMorganChase as a software engineer. I learned how to operate at scale with AWS. 
- I interned at a [ITUS Secure Technologies](https://itus-tech.com/), a Cybersecurity startup that aided the recovery of cybercrime victims, as well as general security managed services.
- I spent a research internship at [NeuroConcise](https://www.neuroconcise.co.uk/). We developed a discreet EEG that allowed Locked-In patients to communicate with previously incommunicable patients.
