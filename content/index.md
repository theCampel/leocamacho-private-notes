title: Hey! I'm Leo 👋
---
I'm a 3rd year [[Computer Science|Computer Science]] student at the [[University of Edinburgh|University of Edinburgh]]. Welcome to my corner of the internet! 

### About Me:
- I ***co-founded*** [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]'s [[AI]] Society, [[EdinburghAI]], where I'm currently ***President***.
- I'm an active member of [[EUFS|EUFS 🏎️]], a society that builds [[Autonomous Vehicles|self-driving]] race cars from scratch. I'm currently trying to use [[AI|Machine Learning]] to optimise the global path around the race track. 
- This past summer, I interned at ***[JPMorganChase](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/global/en/students/programs/software-engineer-summer)*** as a [[Computer Science|software engineer]]! 

> [!question] What is this website?
> It's a blend of my [[Computer Science|University notes]], [[Personal Projects|personal projects]] and [[Essays|written essays]]! You can search for a given topic using the 🔍 icon at the top (eg. *"Memory Hierarchy"*). Alternatively, you can just click around (eg. [[Power Series]])!



> [!example] I was the target audience...
> I write my notes so that ***I*** can come back and re-learn the concepts easily. They're messy, scrappy and incomplete. That's the learning process at the end of the day 😉.
> 
> Also, some hyperlinks may not work - they're likely private notes (eg. [[Spirals|Spirals in Life]])
