## Initial Problem:
Take [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]. It's a great algorithm, but due to the nature of the problem, it's really inefficient as the problem (graph size) grows larger. In fact, the [[Time Complexity|time complexity]] is $O(V^2)$, where $V$ is the number of nodes you have. 

## Mind Blowing Part:
What if you trained a [[Neural Network|neural network]] on the inputs and outputs of a bunch of examples (so start point, end pioi)
