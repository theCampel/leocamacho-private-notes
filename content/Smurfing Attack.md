## What?
Remember that if you send something to [[IP Address]] ending with `.255`, it's a broadcast port. So if you send a ping it, everyone will respond to you saying they exist. But what if you sent a ping to it, pretending to be someone else? Then everyone will send *that* IP with a bunch of ping results. Boom. Genius. I know. It's called a *Reflection Attack*.
