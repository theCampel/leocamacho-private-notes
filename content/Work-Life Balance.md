There's an inherent misconception about a work life balance. It implies the only two things you could be doing with the [[Four Thousand Weeks]] of your life is *Working*, or not *working*. 

As taught to me by the named book, there's actually a third part:
1. Working
2. Not Working (Going for a run to practise for a 10k, developing your personal portfolio)
3. ***Truly*** Resting. This can be inviting friends over for the sole purpose of an evening chat
