### Background:
Humanity has dreamt of a personalised word for decades - personalised nutrition, medicine, and education to name a few. **Why?** Because personalisation enables us to extract the maximal value out of a medium. Everyone in the world is unique, with distinct traits and perceptions of shared experiences. We (historically) tend to create a single blanket technology and apply it to everyone, even though it's less effective for some (source, source, source). Any personalised technology alleviates this problem. 

Historically, it’s largely been technically infeasible, but that’s changing. Precision medicine is [revolutionising cancer treatment](https://publications.ersnet.org/content/errev/26/146/170066). Khan Academy provides every school child with a Socratic [personal tutor](https://www.khanmigo.ai/learners). HelloFresh delivers food to your door, customised to your [nutritional requirements](https://www.hellofresh.co.uk) and schedule. In this essay, I write about a future underwritten by *personalised media*. *(Make last sentence flow nicer)*

### What is Media?
First, let’s define media as the umbrella term for *“a medium of information, expression and entertainment”*. This *(admittedly broad)* definition encapsulates different *form-factors*, including books, radio shows, video games, YouTube videos and *many* more. New forms-factors often *(always?)* spawn as a result of technological progress (books from the Gutenberg Press, podcasts from the ever-lower prices of production and rise in demand). 

### What Media is Next?
Once you've realised that new forms of media arrive with technological progress, it's natural to ask what's the next form-factor? An exact one is hard to predict. Jawed Karim could never have predicted streamer Kai Cenat (or let's-player Joseph Garett, beauty vlogger James Charles, podcaster Joe Rogan, or free educator Stuart Anderson). But the macro-trend *(and consequent success)* of publishing user-generated videos online was obvious *(to them)*. YouTube was made possible due to adoption of high-speed internet, widespread availability of cheaper digital cameras and the introduction of Web 2.0 (and more of course). 

In a similar vein, we can look at the technological progress today and predict a new class of media that will be made possible. As I've written about before,
