### Background:
Humanity has dreamt of a personalised word for decades - personalised nutrition, medicine, and education to name a few. **Why?** Because personalisation enables us to extract the maximal value out of a medium (footnote needed). Historically, it’s largely been technically infeasible, but that’s changing. Precision medicine is [revolutionising cancer treatment](https://publications.ersnet.org/content/errev/26/146/170066).

Jawed Karim could never have predicted Kai Cenat (or Joseph Garett, James Charles, Joe Rogan, or Stuart Anderson).
