### Background:
Humanity has long sought personalisation — in nutrition, medicine, education and beyond. **Why?** Personalisation helps us get the most out of a medium. Everyone in the world is unique, with distinct traits and perceptions of shared experiences. We (historically) tend to create a blanket technology and apply it to everyone, even though it's less effective for some ([source](https://theconversation.com/why-prescription-drugs-can-work-differently-for-different-people-168645#:~:text=Different%20people%20taking%20the%20same,may%20get%20unwanted%20side%20effects.), source, source). Any personalised technology alleviates this problem.

Historically, it’s largely been technically infeasible, but that’s changing. Precision medicine is [revolutionising cancer treatment](https://publications.ersnet.org/content/errev/26/146/170066). Khan Academy provides every school child with a Socratic [personal tutor](https://www.khanmigo.ai/learners). HelloFresh delivers food to your door, customised to your [nutritional requirements](https://www.hellofresh.co.uk/) and schedule. This essay explores a future shaped by personalised media.

### What is Media?
First, let’s define media as the umbrella term for _“a medium of information, expression and entertainment”_. This _(admittedly broad)_ definition encapsulates different _form-factors_, including books, radio shows, video games, YouTube videos and _many_ more. New form-factors consistently emerge from technological progress. For example, books arose from the invention of the Gutenberg Press, while podcasts flourished due to cheaper production costs and increasing demand for on-demand audio content.

### What Media is Next?
Once you've realised that new forms of media arrive with technological progress, it's natural to ask what's the next form-factor? An exact one is hard to predict. Jawed Karim could never have predicted streamer Kai Cenat (or let's-player Joseph Garett, beauty vlogger James Charles, podcaster Joe Rogan, or free educator Stuart Anderson). But the macro-trend _(and consequent success)_ of publishing user-generated videos online was obvious _(to them)_. YouTube was made possible due to adoption of high-speed internet, widespread availability of cheaper digital cameras and the introduction of Web 2.0 (and more of course).

In a similar vein, we can look at the technological progress today and predict a new class of media that will be made possible. Two things stand out: virtual reality and generative AI. While there will inevitably be new form-factors that emerge at the intersection of them, I will focus on where Generative AI intersects with traditional consumption mediums.

Generative AI enables the rapid creation of content, based entirely on customisable criteria. NotebookLM creates (surprisingly engaging) podcasts based on content you feed it. Spotify DJ creates a (terrible) DJ experience based on your music listening habits. But these are both examples of previously existing mediums becoming highly-personalised with modern technologies. While there's certainly value in these, the greatest value will be created by a fundamentally medium. 

## Want to build the next medium?
I've made projects trying to maximise the value in existing mediums using [[Personal Projects#Personalised Radio Station *(BBC Radio4(U))*|modern technology]]. But I'm always on the lookout for the new mediums.
