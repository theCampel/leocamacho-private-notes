> [!caution] Why Bother?
> *I've [[Learning|learned]] to code at 13 (started on Scratch!)*. It's been a significant part of my life. For what? It's incredibly fun. Building something, seeing it come to life and then watching it morph as you constantly tinker on it and poke holes. 

### What is it though?
- The study of [[Algorithms|algorithms]], [[Data Structures|data structures]], and [[Databases|computer systems]] to solve problems effectively and efficiently.  
- Roots in [[Maths]], [[Combinational and Sequential Logic Blocks|Logic]] and [[Software Engineering|engineering]].
