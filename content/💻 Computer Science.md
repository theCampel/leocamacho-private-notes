> [!caution] Why Bother?
> *I've been coding since I was 13 (started on Scratch!)*. It's been a significant part of my life. For what? It's incredibly fun. Building something, seeing it come to life and then watching it morph as you constantly tinker on it and poke holes.

> [!quote ] How did I get started?
> I've always had an interest in computers. But at around 13 years old, I won â‚¬50 in a Scratch competition hosted by a (favourite) teacher of mine, with the objective of making the fastest sorting algorithm. It further hooked me on the field and I've wanted to do this as a living ever since.
