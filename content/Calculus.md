Calculus is a all about the idea of taking a hard problem, splitting it up into a bunch of smaller, easier to calculate problems and then combining them all up. Ideally, if we can 

In it we deal a lot with the [[Derivative]]. This is often referred to as the "Instantaneous Rate of Change", but this statement is quite oxymoronic. 

Also, when using the $d$ in $dx$, you're normally implying that it's a value that will tend to 0.

- [[Rate of Change]]
- [[Derivative]]
- [[Exponents]]
- [[Implicit Differentiation]]
- [[Limits]]
- [[Integrals]]
- [[Taylor Series]]
- [[(Calculus)Tests]]
- [[Symmetry in Calculus]]
- [[Calculus Continuity]]
- [[Squeeze Theorem]]
- [[Local Extrema]]
- [[Calculating Arc Length]]
